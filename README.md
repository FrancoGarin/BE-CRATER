# BE-CRATER
'BE-CRATER for VolcFlow' is a script created to randomize VolcFlow parameters (volume and CRS) and assess their impact on VolcFlow outputs using best fit metrics.  The simulated values are compared against the mapped footprint of deposits from pyroclastic density currents (other flows that VolcFlow is used to simulate. can also be assessed)
